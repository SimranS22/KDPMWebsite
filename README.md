# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Website ü©∫

Welcome to the **Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Website**! This project uses **Flask**, **Python**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, hosted with **GitHub Codespaces**, to create a simple yet powerful web application designed to predict the likelihood of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).

The website provides an intuitive interface for users to input their health parameters, and it uses a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of CKD.

For more details about the model and development process, you can refer to the following GitHub repository: [Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Model](https://github.com/meAnubhav/Kidney-Disease-Prediction-Model).

### Demo

Check out the demo here: [Live Demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85eb07c6-df5a-4bf2-bbbc-b7b48ffa3fd8)

## üõ† **Technologies Used**
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python to build the backend of the application.
- **Python**: The programming language used to power the logic and machine learning model.
- **HTML & CSS**: For building a responsive and user-friendly web interface.
- **GitHub Codespaces**: A cloud-powered development environment that simplifies building and hosting web applications.

## üöÄ **Getting Started with Flask in GitHub Codespaces**
GitHub Codespaces ‚ô•Ô∏è Flask enables an easy setup to create and deploy Flask applications. This project demonstrates how these technologies can be used to develop a website for Chronic Kidney Disease prediction.

### Features
- **Prediction Model**: Uses a machine learning model to assess the likelihood of Chronic Kidney Disease based on user input.
- **Flask Framework**: Powers the backend of the application for smooth and efficient functionality.
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Simplifies the development and hosting of the project in a cloud-based environment.

## üõ† **How to Run This Project**

1. **Open in GitHub Codespaces**:
   Clone the repository or start a new Codespace from your GitHub account.

2. **Set Up Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Flask Application**:
   Start the Flask server using the following command:
   ```bash
   flask --debug run
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

4. **Predict Chronic Kidney Disease**:
   Input the health data in the web interface to get a prediction on the likelihood of CKD.
